My progress making a Rubik's cube solver for my computer engineering class, TEJ4M.

legend: https://github.com/pglass/cube/blob/main/rubik/cube.py

My first major project

a list of things i'm learning as i go
- actually implementing what i learned from object oriented programming e.g. classes
- actually implementing my cadding skills on stuff i'll print
- working with nema17 and a a4988 driver
- soldering
- crimping wires
- designing a schematic
- building process, measuring, drawing diagrams, making protytpes, failures --> improving
- assembling & logistics: physically putting it all together, knowing where things go
- making a complex algorithm to solve the cube
- making an html css js website as user interface to communicate the unsolved rubik's cube
- bluetooth between website and cube
- communciating between js and pytohn

MAYBE
- detecting colors thru a picture, no need to individually specify color of each piece
- just take 6 pictures and done
MAYBE
